##### **Introducing Hanan Kandar**

Hello there! My name is Hanan, I'm fourteen years old and here are some facts about my life!

#### **My name**:
My full name is Hanan Kandar. When I was born, my oldest brother chose my name. The name "Hanan" means compassion and kindness in Arabic.

#### **Family**:
In my family, I have two older brothers, an older sister, and a mother and father. I also have an adorable cat named Liam. I am the youngest child in my family, which can have many perks! Both my parents are from _Lebanon_. I have never actually been there before, but I hope to travel there someday. My siblings and I were all born and raised in _Ottawa, Ontario_.

#### **Favourite Music**
I have always been a fan of older music. I think part of the reason is since my siblings are all ten years or older than me, I was always hearing them blast their music when I was younger.. Some classic singers that I love are Michael Jackson and Elvis Presley. As for more 90s music, I love artists such as "The Backstreet Boys," "NSYNC," "The Spice Girls," etc. As for music that is more of this time, I really love Ed Sheeran's songs. 

#### **Hobbies**: 
Some of my hobbies include...
* Reading
* Watching movies and T.V.
* Biking
* Writing
* Calligraphy

Other than those main hobbies, I love spending time with my family and friends. Lately, I have been doing a lot of volunteer work in the community to complete my 40 hours of community involvement required to graduate. 

#### **Languages That I Speak**
The main language that I speak is of course English. Although, I have been in French Immersion since kindergarten which has led me to be quite fluent. Finally, I know _**some**_ Arabic, but I am not _entirely_ fluent. 

#### **My favourite quote**:
> “No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin, or his background, or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite.”

― Nelson Mandela
